Dataplay
===

Dataplay is a game that is in current prototype by playgen for the [CLEAR](http://celarcloud.eu) project

The Application is written in Golang and the front end is written in Coffeescript.

The backend uses Martini for web route handling, MySQL for database backend (Though this is going to change hopefully to posgres for perma data and cassandra for temp / indexs)

All file's are fed though `go fmt` before they are committed to ensure that there are no major syntax errors or anything strange.S
